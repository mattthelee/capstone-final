This project is my final submission for my Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. I chose to complete a Kaggle competition as it is a real world problem and posed a significant challenge. The data files are not available in this repo as they are too large, instead they can be downloaded from here https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge/data. 

**The write up for this project is visible in the project.pdf file.**

To run the algorithm:
Install: keras, json, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn and numpy. 
As well as the above python packages, the user must install tensorflow as the keras backend. The project was conducted using tensorflow GPU but i believe it could also use tensorflow-cpu if required.
The tensorflow-gpu requires python-tk to be installed.
